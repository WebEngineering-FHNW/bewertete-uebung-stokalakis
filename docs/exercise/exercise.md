Project idea short description: The MusQueue App
[This idea came up to my mind several months ago - I've adapted the scope to meet the webeC project requirements (instead of a smartphone app, I will develop a web app).]

### Problem
Partying with friends. All the boys want to connect to the UE BOOM to play their cool music. Switching beetwen the different devices which are connected to the UE BOOM is painful and time-consuming.

### Solution
I want to program a web app which allows me, sending music titles into a queue. A master device (laptop, pc, ipad) starts the web app and logs into it's MusQueue account. Other users also start the app and log-in into their MusQueue accounts.
The account which acts as the master, needs an active Spotify account. The master is able to create and modify playlists via the Spotify web API. The playlist itself stays with Spotify. The master device is the only device which is connected with the audio device (eg. UE BOOM).
The clients are allowed to connect to the master account and are able to search for music titles and add them to playlist ("Queue").
The master always has the full control over the playlist(s) ("Queues") and is able to add, remove and modify active clients and music titles. A nice to have feature is a poll functionality to allow the clients to vote for certain music titles, genres, singers.

### In scope for webeC
1.  Master & client UI
2.  Ability to create playlists via Spotify web API
3.  Ability to play the playlist and let the clients actively adding titles
4.  Optional: Poll initiation

### Out of scope
1.  Group management
2.  Login mask
